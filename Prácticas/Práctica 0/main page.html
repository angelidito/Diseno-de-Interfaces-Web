		<h3>Testimonials</h3>

		<p>The Jenware onesies were the hit of the baby shower. The custom letter a and handmade quality made this gift
			really stand out among the cookie-cutter clothes from the department store.
			Thanks for the cool Jenware barware. I couldn't wait until I found Mr. Right so I just bought a set for
			myself! My friends always want to know where I got them so I send them to your site.</p>
